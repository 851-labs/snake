# snake

Terminal Snake built with OpenTUI.

## Setup

```bash
bun install
```

OpenTUI requires Zig to build its native components. If you see build errors, install Zig first.

## Run

```bash
bun run start
```

## Install (npm)

```bash
npm i -g @851-labs/snake
```

Or run once with:

```bash
npx @851-labs/snake
```

Then start:

```bash
snake

First run downloads the native binary for your platform.

## Install (Homebrew)

```bash
brew tap 851-labs/tap
brew install snake
```
```

Optional (Bun):

```bash
bun add -g @851-labs/snake
```

```
